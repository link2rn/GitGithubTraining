HI
My name is Aarthik Shrestha.
I wanted to learn computing and coding and have started it now.
I have attended this git and github class operated
by GCA and our teacher Milan thapa. i used github but didnt know a lot.
Now that i have attened this class i have made progress and learned many things
that didnt know could be done in github.
i also made some friends here. the classes were also very fruitful.

And the courses and the classes were very helpful to me willing to join more clases and sessions.
hence i would like to thank GCA and Milan Thapa sir for this class and the knowledge.
