HI
My name is Aarthik Shrestha.
I wanted to learn computing and coding and have started it now.
I have attended this git and github class operated
by GCA and our teacher Milan thapa. i used github but didnt know a lot.
Now that i have attened this class i have made progress and learned many things
that didnt know could be done in github.

i also made some friends here. the classes were also very fruitful.
these session have been very help ful to me and will follow up in more session as well.
